# LearnJavaSelenium
This Project is created to learn Git and Github features.
And to learn Java-Seleinum, gradually moving towards BDD, integrating Cucumber.


#Getting Started
As we are new learners, its easy we can mess up. But this is the best way to learn in my opinion. 
We will learn/remember as we do things in our own. To Start (so far to my knowledge), please do follow below notes:-
1. Fork the repository, by clicking on the "Forks" tab.
2. Give your own name, as suitable to you. 
3. if you want to work on specific feature, you can branch your repository with specific name as feature1, etc..
4. Copy the <url> of the branch you want to reference to.
5. Use that <url> to sync to your local either via git cmd, or via IDE's. 

Prerequisites
